                <h1>Inspiration</h1>
                <p>My paper covers the idea of remastered games. When I was younger, I was given a DS for my 6th birthday. I loved playing Mario Bros., where I would pass the DS around with my Dad. I continued to play these titles, and I loved playing video games, and to which I started coding on my computer. Although I would love to code video games, I turned to coding little programs for fun. Now, I am CS major. Since I am older now, games that I used to play are being remastered, which now looking back at these titles, I feel nostalgic for them. Thus, that is why I focused on nostalgia and video games because I enjoyed them when I was younger.</p>

                <p>After researching, I understood that a person may want to play remastered titles to reconnect with their past self. Their past self thus played these older titles when they were first released, and wanted to relive that experiences</p>

                        <p>I noticed that many people commented that these remastered games are poisoning the gaming industry as it is a repeat of older gameplay and mechanics. However, if the main reason for some is to enjoy their experience and reconnect with their past self, I believe it is ok if there is a little repetition.</p>
